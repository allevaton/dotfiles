# This is a YAML configuration example that contains every

# Unconditionally delete these files. If no absolute path is
# specified, relative path to the synced directory is implied:
Delete:
    - 'README.rst'
    - 'dotfiles_config.yml'
    - 'fix.py'
    - 'doc'

Windows:
    # KeepAll will delete everything that is not contained
    # in the following sections. It will delete the other
    # files AFTER it sorts through these.
    KeepAll: False

    # This should match a file exactly. It can also be a file
    # path if you choose.
    .vimrc:
        Keep: True

        # Note: CopyTo settings take precedence over MoveTo.
        # If both are specified, it will copy the file to the
        # specified location, then move the original one
        # to the destined location.
        MoveTo: ~/_vimrc
        CopyTo: C:/Users/John/_vimrc

    # Putting a '/' as the first character signifies that this
    # will be treated as a regular expressions object and will
    # look for a match at any part of the file.
    /vim$:
        # Even though Keep isn't specified here, it's still
        # going to keep it.
        MoveTo: ~/vimfiles

    .config:
        # Even though this file is specified in this list, if
        # the Keep setting is set to False, it will still delete it.
        Keep: False

Linux:
    # Without this setting, it will still keep all files, but
    # explicit is better than implicit, am I right?
    KeepAll: True
